# R-NIRS-dat-parser
Parser in R for NIR scans (.dat/ascii -> .csv)

Created for NIRS data (wavelengths and predictions) exported from ISIscan to a .dat format.
Creates a parsed.csv file with a timestamp that can be used as input ex. to Unscrambler, R, for further analysis.

An example data file (nirs_example.dat) can be found in the repository. Have fun!
